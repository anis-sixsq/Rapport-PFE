Our graduation project is to design and build a Big Data solution within the SlipStream platform. Basically, it is about automating the process of Hadoop cluster deployment in a Cloud Computing environment. The end user of our project can deploy with a single click a Hadoop cluster on top of a large choice of Cloud providers from the market. An administration consoles will be provided to control and manage Hadoop services and other tools to connect and use the nodes of the deployed cluster.
